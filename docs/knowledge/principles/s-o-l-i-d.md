# S.O.L.I.D: The First 5 Principles of Object Oriented Design

<hr/>

**S.O.L.I.D** is an acronym for the **first five object-oriented design(ODD)**

These priciples, when combined together, make it easy for a programmer to develop sofware that are easy to maintain and extend. They also make it easy for developers to avoid code smells, easily refactor codem and are also a part of the agile or adaptive software development.

When expanded the acronyms might seem complicated, but they are pretty simple to grasp.

- **S** - Signle-responsibilty principle
    - A class should have one and only one reason to change meaning that a class should have only one job.
- **O** - Open-closed principle
    - Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
- **L** - Liskov substitution principle
    - Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.
- **I** - Interface segregation principle
    - A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
- **D** - Dependency Inversion Principle
    - Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.

## Conclusion

Honestly, **S.O.L.I.D** might seem to be a handful at first, but with continuous usage and adherence to its guidelines, it becomes a part of you and your code which can easily be extended, modified, tested, and refactored without any problems.
