# Three Tier Architecture

<hr/>

Three-tier architecture allows any one of the three tiers to be upgraded or replaced independently. The user interface is implemented on a desktop PC and uses a standard grphical user interface with different modules running on the application server. The relational database management system on the database server contains the computer data storge logic. The middle tiers are usuall multitiered.

The three tiers in a three-tier architecture are:

1. Presentation Tier: Occupies the top level and displays information related to services available on a website. This tier communicates with other tiers b sending results to the browser and other tiers in the network.
2. Application Tier: Also called the middle tier, logic tier, business logic or logic tier, this tier is pulled from the presentation tier. It controls application functionality by performing detailed processing.
3. Data Tier: Houses database servers where information is stored and retrieved. Data in this tier is kept independent of application servers or business logic.
