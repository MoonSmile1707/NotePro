# What is Matic Network

<hr/>

## Introduction

Matric network is layer 2 scaling solution that achieves scale by utility sidechains for off-chain but ensuring asset security using the Plasma Framework and a decentralization network of Proof-of-Stake(PoS).

Matric strives to solve scalability and usibility issues while not compromise on decentralization and laveraging the existing developer community and ecosytem. Matic network is an off/side chain scaling solution for existing platforms to provide scalability and superior user experimence to DApps/ user functionality.

## Key Features and Highlights

- **Scalability**: Fast, low-cost and secure transaction on Matic sidechains with finality mainchain and Ethereum as the first compatible Layer 1 basechain.
- **High Throughout**: Achived up to 10.000 TPS on a single sidechains on internal testnet and multiple chains to be added for horizontal scaling.
- **User Experience**: Smooth UX and developer abstraction from mainchain to Matic Chain, native mobile app and SDK with WalletConnect support.
- **Security**: Matic chain operators are themselves stakers in the PoS system.
- **Public Sidechain**: Matic mainchains are public in nature(. vs individual DApps chains), permissionless and capable of supporting multiple protocols.

## Value Propostion

Matic is unique in terms of techniqual approach towards Layer 2 as well as its potential support for a variety use cases.

- Matic Layer 2 is an account-based veriant MoreVP( More Visible Plasma). The Plasma Framework is used to guarentee the security of assets on the main chain(such as ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens for Ethereums). While generic transaction is secured by the Proof on Stakes, built on top of Tendermint. Matic sidechains is essentially EVM-enabled chain and conducive to the ready deployment of solidity smart contracts, essential to make it an easy tool for Ethereum Developer to use it for scaling their DApps/Protocals.
- Commercially, Matic sidechains are structurally effective for supporting the many Decentralized Finance(DeFi) Protocols availlable in the Ethereum ecosystem.
- Matic's core philosophy is to anable DApps to compete with the user experence that is offered by centralized apps today.
- Ethereum is the first basechain Matic Network supports, but Matic intends to offer for additional basechain based on community sugession and consensus, to enable an interoperable descentralized Layer 2 Blockchain platform.
