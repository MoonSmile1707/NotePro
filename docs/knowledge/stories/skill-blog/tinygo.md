# TinyGo - A go compiler for small places

<hr/>

TinyGo is a proect ro bring the Go programming language to microcontrollers and modern web browsers by creating a new compiler based on [LLVM](https://llvm.org/).

You can compile and run TinyGo programs on several different microcontrller boards such as the [BBC micro:bit](https://www.microbit.co.uk/) and the Arduino Uno.

TinyGo can also be used to produce [WebAssembly (WASM)](https://webassembly.org/) code which is very compact in size.

Just want to see the code? Go to the Github repository at https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo

TinyGo also has support for several different devices such as accelerometers and magnetometers. Check out the Github repository at https:// github.com/tingo-org/drivers for more information.
