The DevOps methodology has been recognised by many experts as the best way to promote coopertation between development and opertations teams. However DevOpes is much more than a methodology. It is moree of a culture that makes both the tecnical and business sides of software development much more efficient thus reducing time to market and increasing the overall quality of the product.

## DevOps Definition

- Shared responsibility - In many compnanies, the development team is focused solely on creating the product and can become disintierest or even estranged operating and managing a system if it is somebody else's job. If it s also part of the develppments teams;s reponsibiliy to monitor the system over the course of its existence, they are likely to feel the same pains operations teams are dealing with. This will elad to finding new ways of simpligying deployments and the maintenance bu automatingthe deployments and better logging.
- Autonomous teams - Effective collaboration is only possible when development and opertations teams can make decisions and changes independently without a complicated decision-making process. This includes trusting your teams, adjusting the way risks are managed and getting rid of an enviromet where employees are afraid of teking risks or failing.
- Removing all silos - Some companies document the process and hand this documentation over to another team and condifer this to be regulae cooperation. Such an arrangement is doomed from the start because it promotes a culture of finger pointing and blamling. You must adjust resourcing structure to let operations teams start collaborating with other teams early on. One of the goals of DevOps is to blur the line between development and operations team to the point where there may not be a difference between them at all.

## The DevOps Lifecycle

There are any stages that make up the DevOps lifecycle, but the process will look like the following:

- Plan - This stage includes initial plainning about how you envision the development process.
- Code - Coding the applicaiton according to the requirements of the customer.
- Build - Integrate all of the various codes you have written
- Releases- If the testing phase was successful, the applicationn could go live
- Deploy- The code is deployed to a cloud enviroment for additional usage
- Operate - Conduct the operations on the code.
- Monitoe - Keep an eye on how well the app is performing and make any changes necessary tostisfy the client.

## Why Do We Need DevOps?

DevOps offers a lot of benefits for software programming companies such as increased innovation speed which will allow you to serve your customers better. You will also be more flexible to adjust to changing market conditions and drive higher business results. Since the speed and tempo of the releases will be frequent, you will be able to improve your product faster. This way you can release new features sooner, notice and fix bugs quicker and perhas most importantly, respond to customer demands better to give your business a competitive advanage. Continuous integrateion and delivery (CI/CD) are practices that automate the software release procss starting from the build and all the way to deployment.

Even though the pace of productionn will increase, it hs to be done so reliably. You will lbe able to use CI/CD to test all of the changes and better monitoring logging will help you continuously stay on top of how well your application is doing in real-time. Security process will bot be compromised since the complance policies will be automeated by using fine-grained controls and configuration management techniques.

## Conclusion

You need to have a more structured approach with the understanding that the release schedule might slow down at first as your teams become acquainted the DevOps culture and methodologies. This will require a lot f education, training and som time to get used to all of the changes. As the transition is going on, it is important to set and monitor business critical metrics such as overall revenue and customer satisfaction. There is no point in having multiple releases just for the sake of having various releases. It must make an impact on the bottom line.

Given all of the benefits that DevOps offers it is safe to say that companies who fail to implement DevOps process risk falling behind. One off the most common misconceptions is that DevOps is jus for large companies when in fact small and medium-sized business can take advantage of everything DevOps has to offer. In fact, one of the reasons that companies such Facebook, Netflix, and offer adopters of DevOps and were able to deliver new features to their user faster than the competition. Therefore, if you have not yet begun implementing DevOps, you are falling behind your competitors.
