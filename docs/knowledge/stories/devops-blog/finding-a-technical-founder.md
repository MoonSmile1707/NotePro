# Finding a Tecnical Founder

<hr/>

If you're a non-technical wannapreneur in your late teens or early twenties, then breathe easy - I'm about to drestically increase your chances of seeing an MVP(minimal viable product) all the way through. 90% of the time these attempt luring a technical co-founder fall flatt on their face for two coroe reasons:

- You're displaying a general lack of knowledge/preparation/understanding of the very serious task that lies ahead.
- You such at selling yourself & how you'll equally contribute to s specificaly-defined vision.

There are three main steps that a nontechnical founder should take before reaching out publicly or privately to potential tech co-founders:

I. **Plan An End Goad In Mind**
II. **Fill Your MVP Knowledge Gap**
III. **Prepare A Realistic Budget**

Recall the statement made above: you're pitching yourself as much if not more than the idea itselft.

## Plan End Goal In Mind

Unlike most dreamers that have yet to taste the sourness of a flat launch, any application veteran will confirm: launching an app does not guarantee reliable traffic.

The first turn-ogg I see in nontechnical pitches is a lacking sense of reality. Most business people start their projections with researching market sizes & then extrapolating down through a series of convergences to a projected EBITDA (total market -> direct market -> views etc...) while it's highly recommended that you know these market numbers, I'm going to offer paradoxical advice here: do _not_ tis MVP goals with projections distilled from marketing research.

The margin for error is simply too high & the final value-added for your efforts is quite low. It goes against expected advice, but for an MVP goal, you;re much better off following your intuition. Realistic expectations, well-defined goals & an understanding of industry norms("churn" & "early-adopters")

## Fill Your MVP Knowledge Gap

First, figure out what you need in order to launch an MVP. At the very minimum I'd suggest conducting some research on the native languages required for each app-type needed; in the case of web development, read a bit on the most popular web framework.

Tread this line carefully don't overlook it entirely. You're now starting to come across as someone semi-technical, or at the very least someone that's quite diligent & well-researched; again, you're pitching yourself as much as the idea.

## Prepare A Realistic Budget

I know it hurts to see, but I'm flat-out confirming that any equity-offer void of moola is a no-go. Despite the real progress in product tols intended for nontechincal people, one still needs a solid **$5000 to $10000** budget for a **sir MVP**. It;s possible, _maybe_, that some young college dreamer or Upwork contractor might stretch into the \$2.500 area; but at that point, you're haphazardly approaching the _you-get-what-you-pay-for_ territory.

Most developers don't like designing whatsoever, yet your product undoubted requires an entire design process. Want to shave 10% to 34% off the prices posted above> Show up with a full prototype fleshed out. Yes, this might take massive actio on your part.

Either way, get it done because this is the litmus test - if you can't approach a technical parter with a realistic budget, or a lesser budgt but completed designs, forget about it.
