<hr/>

There is. And it is a 4-step process called Q.U.I.T.

- **Q** - Question your Passion
- **U** - Understand Your Reputation
- **I** - Investigate your skills
- **T** - Test the waters

## Q - Question Your Passion

The 1st step is to firm your passion and confirm whether it is "**true**" or "**false**".

These are some of the ways in which you can do it.

### Is your Passion your own or imposed one?

If you are just thinking of "**copying**", then you are on the wrong path here.

You need to know "**what you want to do**" and "**what is your potential**". That i the true test of your passion.

### Is your Passion a stop-gap arrangement or the End Story?

You believe that once your point is "proven", you can again go back to the cushy comforts for your job.

#### You can never be more wrong than this

A passion has to be the end goal. It can ever be a "stop-gap" arrangement. If you treat it like that, your startup is already "**finished**" before it hs started.

## Is your Passionn only a Passing Fad?

Technology Trends are like Fashion. They come and go every day and there is constant disruption. But amidst all this disruption, the one thing that remains constant is innovation. Startups which have the mettle to constantly innovate and stay ahead of the disruption curve survive the game. Others just wither and die.

You need to ask yourself an important question here: **Are you a chaser or a changer?**

A casher just cashes on the current market trend, makes some money and exits. There is no real passion involved here. A changer on the other hand, contantly "**reworks**" his product and stays ahead in the game. Your passionn is a "**true**" if it is that of a changer.

## U - Undrstand your Reputation

Once you have confirmed your passion. The next step is to understand the power of your reputation. Your reputation needs to be Steller enough to shoulder the burden of your unknown startup. Some of the ways you can do it can be as below.

### Is your reputation self-made or company made?

You fell your outstanding reputation is the key to help you find customers for your startup.

#### Now just go back a step and think abour your "reputation"

your personal reptationn should always be based on your unique abilities and talents independent of "company provided" facilities or processes. Your "potential" customer should be able to recognize this ability in you to proceed further.

Their "belief" in you should be absolute whether you are working for a big company or your own startup.

### How Trustworthy are your contacts?

Analyze and categorie your contacts into 3 groups.

- **High peofile contact: approachable for "business"**
- **High profile contact: not approachable for "business"**
- **Casual contacts**

You should have at least 40% of your contacts approachable for "business" to make a good start. This will not only help you to give that initial tractiono but will also build up an early stellar reputation of your startup.

Always remember making a great product is not enough. You also nees "customers" who can vouch for the product based on your "reputation".

## I - Investigate your Skills

One your passion and reputation are proved beyond doubt, we come to the meat of the problem-the **skills**
you have to take your startup forward. We require three types of Skills here.

### Core Skills

Core Skills are your "**bread and butter**" of your start-up. They can range from anything between AI, robotics to our boring PHP. These tecnical skills are the foundation for the great product that you are building and it is important that you and your co-founders have "**near-perfect**" expertise in these skills.

Do a through audit of your core skills and map them on a scale between 1 to 10 Majority of the skills going above 8 would mean, you are good to go.

### Management Skills

These are soft skills like leadership, team building, resourcing, and negotiations. But these are very very important. So if you have worked all your life in building great technical stuff and never had the "experience" to manage a project or a team, you might have a serious handicap here. In that case, you need to get these complementary skills from your co-founder.

Everything from ideas to finances will be hazy during the initial days of the startup and it is very important to have strong management skills to optimally use the meager resources and get maximum out of them. So never under
estimate its importance.

### Peripheral Skills

You need to take care of these fictions also and it is important for you to get a deep-dive understanding of these functions to perform effectively. These "**supporting**" functions have the potential to make or break your startup so you need to get yourseld trained in these areas also. It will be great if you can find these skills as complementary in your co-founders.

## T- Test the waters

Now if you have reached so far successfully, it is time to test the waters. We need to utilize all "**approachable**" contacts whom we had identified earlier.

### What do the "Feelers" say?

This is where "feelers" can help you. A feeler is just a brief description of the idea along with the top 2-3 potential benefits. This can be either an email, a short presentation of even a casual discussionn at a coffee shop.

The basic purpose to get a "feel" of the customer's mind before proceeding forward. Care should be taken here only to reveal the "**what you are doing**" part keeping the "**how**" part in vague details.

if 70% or more of your contacs show interest in your idea, you are on the right path.

### Show a Demo

It is worth investing time and effort if the "potential" contract is going to become a "confirmed" customer. Such customers will be visibly exvited by your idea and cannot wait till they see it "working".

you can plan a prototype of "limited version" for these customers which just showcases the meat of your product. This will not only build the customer confidence but will also build the confidence of your own team and give them "something" tangible to start working with. These demos are highly useful for negotiations with angel investors also.

### Bringing it all together

Many of us were raised with a belief that we can be anything we want to be and fed with the idea that if we pursue our passion, money will follow. Most of us buy this mantra, but in real life, things are never as simple as they seem.

Real life requires retionality, logic and perennial inspection and improvement of our own self.

And one of the more irresponsible interpretatios of "**following your dreams**" is the assumptionn that your happiness depends on it. Never equate happiness with passion. You are entering into an unending loop of frustraion and despair by doing that.
