# You Could Have Today Instead You Choose Tomorrow

<hr/>

_You don't have to do a lot every day, but you have to do something._
_Something. Every day._

Some what is that something?

When you know what that something is, suddenly you have power and clarity and control. You know what to say yes to. What to say no to. You know who you are and what your life needs to be built around.

One can't design a life around what it's like to be on vacation. Vacations are not real. They cost money. They happend somewhere far away from where you live. Life can't be filled with the day of your greatest, most impressive accomplishment either. To be Tom Brady every day, coming back from 28-3 in the Super Bowl to pull off a surprise victory in overtime- that would be exhausting. That's great once.

What we need is something sustainable. [Something balances](https://medium.com/thrive-global/33-ways-to-be-an-insanely-productive-happy-and-balanced-person-aec8ad9deecd). Something deliberate without being forced. Purposefull without being obsessed with productivity. We need something like a great Saturday - or one of those Mondays where you're not sure if it's part of a three-day weekend, resulting in just enough work that it's productive, but not so much that it's a chore.

The funny thing is, as much as I enjoy these days, they are fleeting and rate. Why is it that I allow Webnesday to suck? Why do I choose for Tuesday to be filled with meetings that I don't remember agreeing to attend? Or phone calls that I answer?

Part of the answer is that yes, I must make a living, but the truth is , my best work never comes on those crappy days. In fact, the idea for the book project I am selling now came to me on one of those long walks. And that's what pays for my house, not the emails I spend so much time responding to.

    'You could be good today,' the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius wrotr. 'But instead you choose tomorrow.'

Early I said that those Satuedays were the kinds of days to build a life around. I think the mistake is that a lot of people try to build a life toward them instead. What's that line from the famous Loverboy song?

_Everybody's working fr the weekend._

Today could be that amazing day for you. Today could be how you want life to be. You just have to choose for it to be. Or rather, stop choosing for it not to be.
