# Introduction to ASP.NET Core

<hr/>

ASP.NET COre is a cross-platform, high performance, open-source framework for building modern, cloud-based, internet-connected applications, With ASP.NET Core, you can:

- Build web apps and services, IoT apps,and mobile backends.
- Use your favorite development tools on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Deploy to the cloud or on-premises.
- Run on [.Net Core or .NET Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/standard/choosing-core-framework-server).

## Why choose ASP.NET Core?

Millons of developers have used (and continue to use)[ASP.NET 4.x](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/overview) to create web apps. ASP.NET Core is a redesign of ASP.NET 4.x, with architectural changes that result in a leaner, more modular framework.

ASP.NET Core provides the following benefits:

- A unified story for building web UI and web APIs.
- Architected for testability.
- Razor Pages makes coding page-focused screnarios easier and more productive.
- Ability to develop and run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Open-source and community-focused.
- Integration of modern, client-side framework and development workflows.
- A cloud-ready, environment-based configuration system.
- A lightweight, high-performance, and modular HTTP request pipeline.
- Ability to host on IIS, Nginx, Apache, Docker, or self-host in your own process.
- Side-by-side app versioning when targeting .NET Core.
- Tooling that simplified modern web development.

## Build web APOs and web UI using ASP.NET Core MVC

ASP.NET Core MVC provides features to build web APIs and web apps.

- The Model-View Controller pattern helps make your web APIs and web apps testable.
- Razor Pages is a page-based progamming model that makes building web UI easier and more productive.
- Razor markup provides a productive syntax for Razor Pages adn MVC views.
- Tag Helpers enable server0side code to participate in creating and rendering HTML elements in Razor files.
- Built-in support for multiple data formats and content negotiation lets your web APIs reach a broad range of clients, including browsers and mobile devices.
- Model binding automatically maps data from HTTP requests to action method parameters.
- Model validation automatically prtforms client-side and server-side validation.

## Client-side development

ASP.NET Core integrates seamlessly with popular client-side frameworks and libraries, including Blazor, Angular, React, and Bootstrap. For more information, see [Introduction to Blazor in ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/overview) and related topic under Client-side development.
